Pydoncli is the command line interface (CLI) for running pydon. This is not recommended for the ide-fantasy project, because it does not allow one to check the port number and the osc command where the data are sent.

One can run pydon using the command line interface (CLI), by entering the command given below on a shell terminal.

It must be run from the same directory as the .xml config file is located.
The command is:

#+begin_center sh
sudo pydoncli.py -P osc -c newconfig_2019_Dec_13_13-28-37.xml -s /dev/ttyUSB0
#+end_center
